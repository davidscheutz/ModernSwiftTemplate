# Title missing

## Welcome

What do projects from inspiring tech-companies such as Spotify, Snapchat, Block (Square) etc. have in common?

They don't just follow "known best practises". Instead, they come up with their own architecture and frameworks to better support their needs.

This requires a deep understanding of both the requirements of the project and the core principles of building high-quality software. 

The true value lies in the latter:

By truly understanding those engineering principles, you will be able to more acurately evaluate both new and existing paradigms, resulting in improved decision making, 
innovate effectively in your field, ...,
address issues at their root cause, ... and outlast any technology change. 

In this project, we will explore these principles, encouraging you to think critically about conventional best practices and how they can be adapted or even completely rethought to get closer to our global maximum.

## Triangle of Trade-offs / The Challange

The aim is to build up as many of those attributes, 
The aim is to build a system that encompasses attributes,

"Priorities" are choosen

#### 1. Simplicity

Personally, if there is one thing I value the most, it's  simplicity.

Simple means less mistakes, more joy, easier to maintain, 

All together providing the foundation for a efficient and enjoyable development experience ...

**Thread/Risk**

it starts simple and grows in complexity over time

#### 2. Modularity

If something is modular, it's usually more flexible and expands more easily

More granular increases the chances for reusabilty.

**thread/risk:**

 threatening simplicity, by ... This can be avoid by ...


#### 3. Cohesivness / Consistency
 
Change is pain.

..

#### 4. Testability

...

#### 5. Scalability (vertically and horizontally)

...

// Summary

Any project that lifes up to those attributes, 

So it's not about the architecture you choose, but the attributes it will provide.

## Use case: Todo App

...

## Installation

#### 1. Add Swift Package
You can use the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) to install `SwiftCopy` by adding it as a dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

Feel free to take a look at the `SwiftCopyDemo.xcodeproj` to see the library in action. The usage is demonstrated using tests, which can be found in `SwiftCopyDemoTests.swift` file.
